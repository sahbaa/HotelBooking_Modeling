# Hotel Bookings Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on the Hotel Bookings Dataset, which has been meticulously preprocessed and analyzed to develop a robust classification model. The primary goal was to classify the outcomes related to hotel bookings using advanced tree-based algorithms, including Decision Trees and XGBoost.

## Dataset
The dataset provides detailed information about hotel bookings, including booking characteristics, customer demographics, and stay details. It has been carefully preprocessed to ensure the data is clean, structured, and ready for model input.

## Key Features of the Dataset:
Booking information such as cancellation status, lead time, and booking channels
Customer details like number of adults, children, and country of origin
Stay details including length of stay and type of room reserved
Additional features like special requests and meal plans
The dataset is saved as hotel_bookings.csv in this repository.

## Preprocessing
## The preprocessing pipeline includes:

**Handling Missing Values**: Missing entries were imputed or removed based on their impact on the analysis.
**Feature Engineering**: Additional features were derived from the existing data to enhance model performance.
**Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded using appropriate techniques (e.g., One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).
**Scaling**: Numerical features were scaled to improve the convergence of the models.
## Classification Models
## Three models were implemented for classification:
**Decision Trees
XGBoost
CatBoostClassifier**
Utilized the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm for improved accuracy and performance.
## Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model.
## Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Confusion Matrix for detailed error analysis
Results
## The XGBoost model outperformed the Decision Tree classifier in terms of accuracy and robustness, showcasing its ability to handle complex relationships within the dataset.
